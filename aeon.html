                <p class="centered">Aeon Agency is a web based Agency. It's main goal is to create fantastic web and mobile applications with creative and outstanding visual experiences. Aeon stands out as one of th agenies that has an unique user experience approach, creating visual pieces that brake the common meta of the UI design </p>

                <h3 class="centered">General Design Language </h3>
                <p class="centered">I wanted the vision for Aeon Agency to be that of simplicity and minimalism with a touch of smoothness and delight. The main focus 
                  was making a design that seems super basic to the naked eye, but had a complexity to it and a charackter to go with that, conveying a message of simplicity and sophistication at the same time. To execute the visin, we used a black and white combo that switched colors on the same page, going from black to white when a certain view port was hit.
                We also combined that with streamline vector graphics and minimalistic illustrations which made everything loog modern and well composed. </p>
              <p>A lot of competition research was made before figuring out the design language, we made extensive cons and pros research on similar agencies that were in the venue and figured out how to compose our identity so it stood out from the croud and had no corelatence with other agencies.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="twocol2">
                <div class="left-aeon">
                  <h3>Presentation</h3>
                  <p>We decided to create diversity and made several of the pages 100vh with smooth transitioning animations and creative UX features, while keeping the main pages with an unrestricted height, also adding some amazing smart sliders with amazing UX features. We made everything in such a way that it could be transfered to the mobile design afterwards.

                <div class="textfield">
                  <h3>Mobile Design</h3>
                  <p>The mobile design is nothing too complex or mind boggling. It is minimal, slick and clean. No elements were disabled when switching to mobile overview. Nothing much can be said about the mobile version, other than it being extremely smooth and responsive, being coded with slick and smooth animations.</p>
                  <p>The only thing we had to edit throughout the entire mobile layout was the general typography sizes, which wasn't any hard to do at all.</p>
                  <p>The mobile design is fantastic for retina and oled displays because of the two tone black and white combination, or any other display that has true black technology integrated. This also goes for any desktop displays that have the technology. This also creates amazing focus points on the content and promises a clutter free user experience.</p>

                <div class="textfield">
                  <h3>Typography</h3>
                  <p>The Typography font choice had to be something unorthodox. Typically I hate working with the basic fonts like Poppins and Roboto, although in some cases they make an amazing presentation, this time the font of choice was a freemium font.</p>
                  <p>
                    <p>Also, I must not that the design's fundamental is actually based on Typography as a means of visual representation.</p>
                    <p>
                    For typography we chose Inter.
                    
                    Inter features a tall x-height to aid in readability of mixed-case and lower-case text. Several OpenType features are provided as well, like contextual alternates that adjusts punctuation depending on the shape of surrounding glyphs, slashed zero for when you need to disambiguate “0” from “o”, tabular numbers, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>The overall fusion of dark deep colors and the crisp and clean visual aesthetic of Inter made an amazing fusion that blend in the final product.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="image-mobile">

              </div>

              <h3 class="centered">Branding</h3>
              <p class="centered">
                The Branding is not something that I made myself. The logo was provided to us by a third party designer but was further changed by me, because the original logo was too much similar to the beats logo.
                The logo's font is Helvetica Nuene, whih is a verry strong and quality font. It is the Letter a, lower case with some adjustments and curveture, and the follow up text is the same font.
              </p>
              <p class="centered" >Helvetica Nuene is super similar to Inter, which makes the logo blend with the general typography choice very well.</p>

                <div class="left-aeon">
                  <h3>Business Cards Personal</h3>
                  <p>I decided to create a streamline business card that went along with the overall design langauge of our website for myself. This is something that I use personally but I decided to insert the design in the portfolio anyway. </p>
                  <p>The overall look is relative to the white website styling, following the main styleguide. I decided to drop the round logotype on the cards but replace it with the First letter of my name, in thus keeping the original logotype feel and incorporating it without it actually being there.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="right-brand">
                  <h3>Business Cards Corporate</h3>
                  <p>The corporate business card on the other hand has nothing to do with the personal one that is shown above. For the corporate card I wanted to show off complexity and simplicity, as they go hand to hand.
                    The goal was to keep the minimal styleguide from our website and incorporate a touch of visual aesthetics and creativity that showcased that we were a creative agency that embodies the flow of expression.
                    Thus comes the illustrated card which is a blend of abstract shapes that within themselves create a more compelx composition.

                 <p>Given the growth of the IT sector it was really hard for us to find places for free and paid advertisment. We had to look in unorthodox places which took us a lot of research and planning to find what fit the best price.
                   Most people should know that advertising a branding and web development agency on facebook twitter or instagram just wont cut it, so we went with paid advertisment in specific websites that had a good traccif going to them and were relative to the field.
